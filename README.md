# Module 11 Challenge:Â Web Scraping

In this challenge, I honed skills in identifying HTML elements, extracting information through automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup, and scraping diverse data types including HTML tables and recurring elements like news articles.

The repository contains a folder titled "web scraping_challenge" which includes the following files and files:

part_1_mars_news.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains code for scraping Mars news titles and preview text from relevant sources.

part_2_mars_weather.ipynb: Inside this notebook, you'll find code for scraping Mars weather data. Additionally, it includes data cleaning, visualization, and analysis steps.

mars_weather.csv: As outlined in Step 6 of part 2, the notebook exports the processed DataFrame to a CSV file
